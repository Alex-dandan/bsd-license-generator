## Inspiration

My inspiration came from [soulsphere]'s BSD license generator which was written in Ruby and no longer works. I decided to write my own and release the [source code] under the BSD license (of course).

### Colophon

This website was written in [Python] using the [Flask] website framework and is hosted on [Heroku] under [gunicorn]. The templates are rendered with [Jinja2] and [Flask-Markdown]. The design is based on the [Twitter Bootstrap] framework.
